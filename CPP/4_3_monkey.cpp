// Problem Statement:

// Amena has just learned alphabets. She can read write from a to z only in lowercase. But, Amena always writes in alphabetic order (alphabetic order means from a to z in sorted order) what she saw. Also she writes a line as a word. For example, she writes monkey as ekmnoy. Her mother wants to test her reading and writing skills. Her mother gave her some lines, can you tell what she will write?

// Note: Input will be given by EOF.

// Input Format

// Input consist of a line S. The line will contain lowercase letters and spaces. It is possible that there are multiple spaces together and the line end with spaces.
// Constraints

// 1 <= |S| <= 10^5
// Output Format

// Output what Amena will write.
// Sample Input 0

// monkey
// i love flower
// Sample Output 0

// ekmnoy
// eefilloorvw
